CATEGORY: FORENSICS REPORTS FOR ONGOING INVESTIGATION

SUBJECT: UNKNOWN, A/K/A “SHITTY BILL”

HEADER: REPORTS ON DNA ANALYSIS AND OFFICER ██████ ‘S CAMERA

On 18 February 2051, Officer ██████ of NT/SEC/CORP/PHYS logged in one (1) camera, standard issue
NT/SEC, and one (1) DNA sample for analysis.  The officer stated that there was some data corruption
on the camera, and wished to know if the data could be recovered, and if the cause of the data
corruption could be determined.  The DNA sample was to be given a standard analysis for
identification and mutations.

The camera was analyzed and it was discovered that three images, taken between 08:35Z and 08:51Z
18-February 2052, had suffered data corruption to the point where the data could not be recovered.
No other data on the camera had suffered any corruption, including a variety of photographs taken
between 15:48Z 16-February 2052 and 10:14Z 18-February 2052.  At this point I am required to suggest
that Officer ██████ be given additional training as to the proper use of NanoTrasen equipment, as
several of the photographs were clearly of a personal nature, being of himself, out of uniform, and
not marked as an attachment to an investigation.  Although I am not required by policy to suggest
this, decency and compassion require me to also suggest that Officer ██████ be strongly encouraged
to visit the infirmary and have blood tests done to test for infection.

The camera itself was examined thoroughly, and found to be within nominal specifications.  No damage
was found to the casing or interior components, the moisture strip showed no signs of fluid
immersion, and the anti-tampering seals were intact.  Curiously, the interior circuitry did not show
the signs associated with the high-energy RF interference that would be the only remaining possible
cause of data corruption.  No reason could be found for the data corruption.

The DNA sample, upon analysis, proved to be strange.  The sample itself was of a normal human male
of European descent, but the mitochondrial DNA was not a match for any known current human
bloodline, nor did it bear even a passing resemblance to any known current human bloodline.  One of
two conclusions can be drawn from this: Either the subject is of a bloodline that has had all
records of its existence expunged (NT/ADMIN note: refer this matter to the offices of ██████ at
earliest opportunity for research), or the subject exists separately of any known current human
bloodline.  Records from Earth entities have been requested for historical comparison and this
report will be appended with findings upon their arrival and analysis.
