PERSONNEL INVESTIGATION # 39727623

CATEGORY: BACKGROUND CHECK ANOMALY, ████████████.

SUBJECT: UNKNOWN, A/K/A “SHITTY BILL”

HEADER: UNDETERMINED NATURE OF POSSIBLE PREVIOUS NT/PROD/SCI ASSET

BODY: On 21 August 2051, a person assumed to be a wandering vagrant appeared at a civilian diner in
static rotation synchronized with the geological bodies in an asteroid field near Space Station 13.
Various crewmembers have, at different times, reported to NT/SEC and NT/ADMIN that the person,
identified only as “Shitty Bill”, displays mannerisms and speech patterns consistent with an
NT/PROD/SCI employee, despite denying previous contract with NT/ANY or any knowledge of the activity
of NT/ANY beyond things mentioned in passing by other NT/ANY assets.

On 18 February 2052, Officer ██████ of NT/SEC/CORP/PHYS travelled to the diner to interview the
subject.  The subject appeared to be under the influence of mind-altering substances and gave no
useful information during the interview.  A DNA sample was collected and the subject was instructed
to contact Officer ██████ when he was no longer influenced by mind-altering substances, which the
subject replied to with incredulity and implied that such a time would not come to pass in either of
their lifetimes.  No further contact has been logged.

Analysis of the DNA sample proved inconclusive.  The subject’s DNA showed no particular
abnormalities or mutations, but the DNA profile did not bear even a slight resemblance to current
bloodlines.

Furthermore, although a photograph of the subject was taken at the time of the interview, the image
file was irretrievably corrupted before being transferred to storage.  No fault was detected on
Officer ██████‘s camera, and no other image files were corrupted.  There are currently no theories
as to how the file became damaged.  A composite sketch of the subject is attached to this report.

NT/SEC/CORP/PHYS officers led by Officer ██████ returned to the diner in an attempt to retrieve and
analyze the subject, but the subject was not present.  Interviews with other parties at the diner
revealed that the subject had recently left, but the interviewees were unable to clarify how long
the subject had been gone, or where the subject had said it was going.  Analysis of EEG data, heart
rate, and ██████ imply ██████ strongly that the interviewees were telling the whole truth to the
best of their ability, but they were simply unable to clearly remember exactly how long the subject
had been gone or the subject’s stated destination.  The officers were unable to determine any hint
as to when the subject had left, or the subject’s intended destination. ██████ residue indicating
recent teleportation was not found.

After several attempts to retrieve the subject met with similar failure, it can only be determined
that the subject is intentionally eluding NT/SEC officers, and has the ability to do so in such a
way that we are currently unable to retrieve the subject.  Further retrieval attempts have been
suspended pending further orders from NT/SEC, NT/ADMIN, or ██████.
