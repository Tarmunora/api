PERSONNEL INVESTIGATION # 39727623-B

CATEGORY: INTERVIEW NOTES

SUBJECT: UNKNOWN, A/K/A “SHITTY BILL”

INTERVIEWER: OFFICER ██████, NT/SEC/CORP/PHYS # █-█████-██

TIMESTAMP: 08:35Z 18-FEBRUARY 2052


INTERVIEWER: I’ve started the recording.  To restate what you agreed to previously, you give me
permission to record this interview, is that correct?

SUBJECT: Huh?

INTERVIEWER: Do I have your permission to record.

SUBJECT: Oh. Yeah, okay.

INTERVIEWER: Could you state your name, please.

SUBJECT: I’m Shitty Bill.

INTERVIEWER: Sir, I need your legal name.

SUBJECT: Don’t have one.

INTERVIEWER: What is the name on your identification?

SUBJECT: Don’t have that neither.

INTERVIEWER: What is the name on your birth certificate?

SUBJECT: Never got one.  Born just fine without it, ha ha!

INTERVIEWER: Let’s move on.

SUBJECT: Say, did I ever tell you about that time I found a locker fulla booze?

INTERVIEWER: Sir, we’ve never met before today.

SUBJECT: That was a great day.

INTERVIEWER: Have you ever been a member, employee, conscript, indentured servant, subject, or
contractor directly for, or for a business affiliated with, NanoTrasen or any of its subsidiaries?

SUBJECT: What?

INTERVIEWER: Sir, have you ever worked for or with NanoTrasen?

SUBJECT: Well, I –

INTERVIEWER NOTE: At this time, a man in a grey jumpsuit entered the diner.  He injected the subject
with a hypospray that caused the subject to immediately grow a large beard, punched another diner
patron, and went into the back room.

SUBJECT: Whoah! Ha ha!

INTERVIEWER NOTE: At this time, the subject began to clap.  The man in the grey jumpsuit left the
back room carrying a large sack which appeared to be bleeding.  He entered the teleportation chamber
and left.

INTERVIEWER: Have you ever worked for or with NanoTrasen? SUBJECT: Who’s that?

INTERVIEWER: NanoTrasen is the corporation that owns the contract to operate in this sector, and
supplied the materials to build all authorized structures here, including this diner.  There have
been reports that you have said things which strongly imply you either have been a NanoTrasen
associate in the past, or are closely associated with one who is or was.  Have you ever worked for
or with NanoTrasen?

SUBJECT: Whoah!  That was some good stuff!

INTERVIEWER NOTE: At this time, the subject began to sing an ‘old spacer shanty’ which I cannot
record here without violating the Decency in Written Communication Act of 2032, the Sedition Act of
1918, and NanoTrasen corporate policy.

INTERVIEWER: Sir, I need you to focus.  Are you in command of your facilities?

SUBJECT: What? Say, buddy, got any smuds?

INTERVIEWER: Are you high?

SUBJECT: Most of the time, yeah!

INTERVIEWER: Sir, I would like to continue this discussion when you are not under the influence.  If
you’ll accompany me, I will take you to a berthing where you will be comfortable and able to recover
–

SUBJECT: ‘Cept when I’m drunk! HA!

INTERVIEWER: I would be happy to bring you to safe and clean accomodations.

SUBJECT: Nah I’m staying here.

INTERVIEWER: Sir, I think it would be best if –

SUBJECT: I ain’t going.

INTERVIEWER NOTE: Subject began to display signs of agitation.  As I had not been given a warrant
for his arrest, nor had NanoTrasen Admin issued a writ of attainder, I had no legal basis for
compelling the subject to accompany me.

INTERVIEWER: Perhaps I could return when you have recovered.

SUBJECT: What do you mean?

INTERVIEWER: When you’re sober.

SUBJECT: Neither of us’ll live long enough, buddy.  Ha ha!

INTERVIEWER: I will return another time, perhaps you’ll be sober then.

SUBJECT: Could be, man.  Everything’s eventual.

INTERVIEWER NOTE: Subject proceeded to vomit on the floor. A large amount of what appeared to be
ants crawled out of the emesis and scattered.

SUBJECT: Whoah! I don’t remember eating that.

INTERVIEWER: I would suggest you seek medical care.  In the meantime, I will return to complete the
interview another time.

SUBJECT: Go, then.  There are other worlds than these.

INTERVIEWER: What?

SUBJECT: Huh?

INTERVIEWER: Nevermind.  Let me just get the reco –

** RECORDING STOPS **

INTERVIEWER NOTE: Several photographs of the subject were taken during the interview, both before
and after he was dosed with the unknown substance.  However, all image files were corrupted while on
the camera.  No other image files were corrupted, and the camera was examined by NT/SEC/FORN and no
fault was discovered.  A composite sketch was created and has been submitted with this
transcription.
